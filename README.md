# streamlit
In this Streamlit folder, I have kepy all the Python files which we can directly deploy the ML models via streamlit application.

Through Anaconda  command prompt, use command like 'streamlit run <<github link of that specific python file'
e.g. 
streamlit run https://github.com/ipvikas/streamlit/blob/main/ocr.py
